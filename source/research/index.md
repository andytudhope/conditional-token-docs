# Research at Gnosis

Take a wander through our latest research papers and get involved with cutting-edge development. This is your opportunity to work with the best and brightest working on blockchains.

### Batch Auctions

[Read more](https://github.com/gnosis/dex-research/blob/master/BatchAuctionOptimization/batchauctions.pdf) about the problem of multi-token batch auctions with uniform clearing prices as a price-finding mechanism proposed for a decentralized token trading platform. You'll also find some solution approaches based on combinatorial optimization formulations, as well as some computational results.

### Batch.Trade

Blockchains and specifically smart contracts are a promising tool to enable a secure and fair trading ecosystem. The first exchanges built on these technologies emulate the traditional continuous double auction design. Existing solutions that do not rely on a centralized operator face significant challenges with front-running.

[This paper](https://github.com/gnosis/dex-research/blob/master/dFusion/dfusion.v1.pdf) proposes a new trading concept that uses discrete double auctions and time lapse order encryption. The protocol eliminates front-running, provides information symmetry for all participants, and is fully decentralized in the sense that there is no central party operating the system.

### Fee Structures

Due to the design of the Batch protocol outlined above, we've also been researching [possible fee structures](https://github.com/gnosis/dex-research/blob/master/fee-structure/fee-structure.md) for decentralized trading protocols.

Designing autonomous or semi-autonomous mechanisms for decentralized systems requires accommodating multiple tradeoffs under the overarching goal of ensuring ongoing operation in a trustless environment. Some objectives will be specifically defined as primary system goals, but the common objectives of **security** and **ease of access** tend to be somewhat in conflict in all systems, so a primary design principle is to find the right combination of the two that is not just a compromise.

This paper expresses some design process fundamentals by which a token-based system can ensure these goals are met. The fundamental paradox is outlined first and then we propose a process-based method to reach viability.
